# Contributing to Pico-Framework

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Pico-Framework project.

This framework is designed for building modular, event-driven web applications on the Raspberry Pi Pico W, Pi PIco 2 W as well as compatible RP2350 and RP2040-based platforms.

## ‚úÖ What We're Looking For

Right now, our focus is **stability, completeness, and usability**. You can help by:

- Validating that demos build and run cleanly on both Pico and Pico W (RP2040 and RP2040.2)
- Improving documentation, setup instructions, or usability notes
- Suggesting ways to simplify or strengthen existing features (especially HTTP, JSON, storage, events, and task orchestration)

## ‚ùå What We're Not Accepting (Yet)

We are **not currently accepting proposals for major new features** unless they are:

- Essential to complete the MVP
- Required for interoperability or user-critical workflows

We'll revisit feature expansion after our initial release and feedback cycle. We do have plenty of ideas for enhancement.

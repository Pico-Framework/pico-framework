# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The Pico-Framework is currently in early preview. Security guarantees are limited while core APIs and internals are still stabilizing.

We will begin formal vulnerability triage and patching policies starting with v1.0.0.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in Pico-Framework:

- Please **do not open a GitHub issue**
- Instead, email Ian Archbell directly at **ian.archbell@gmail.com**
- Provide as much detail as possible, including reproduction steps

We will acknowledge all valid reports within 48 hours and aim to resolve critical issues promptly.

## Commitment

Pico-Framework will adopt full CVE tracking and coordinated disclosure support once the project reaches a stable release milestone.
